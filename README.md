# SarmadCamp
I have made a campground where people could explore campgrounds made by different users, can create their own campground, and even provide a review for a campground they have visited. 
The map shows the location of all the campgrounds. The country and city where that campground is located. 


Non-registered users can only view the campground, their location and all the relevant details related to that campground. 
They will not be able to see reviews made by the users nor provide any review unless they register.


Registered users can create a new campground, can provide a review for a particular campground. Can only edit/delete their own reviews and campgrounds. 
For example if a registered user has created a new campground only that user can edit/delete their own created campground. Another registered user views to that created campground, there that user could only provide a review but cannot edit/delete the campground created by another user.
